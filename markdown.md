## What is Markdown?

## How to write text in Markdown

### Emphasis

Emphasis allows you to draw attention to particular bits of text.

```
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_
```

Looks like: *This text will be italic*

```
**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__
```

Looks like: **This text will be bold**

```
_You **can** combine them_
```

### Headers

Headers give your writing structure, allowing you to create different sections for your content.

```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6
```

### Links

Links are made up of square brackets containing the display text for the link, followed by parentheses containing the URL.

```
[PyLadies Website](http://www.pyladies.com/)
```

Looks like: [PyLadies Website](http://www.pyladies.com/)

### Images

Images can be added to your Markdown. They follow the Links format, but you add an exclamation mark at the beginning.

```
![Image of kitten](http://placekitten.com/200/200)
```

Looks like:

![Image of kitten](http://placekitten.com/200/200)
